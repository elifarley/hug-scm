[View Documentation](https://elifarley.github.io/hug-scm/)

A humane, intuitive interface for Git and other version control systems.

Works as a universal language to control the underlying SCM tool you use.

Hug transforms complex and forgettable Git commands into a simple, predictable language that feels natural to use, keeping you focused on your code, not on wrestling with version control.

## What is Hug?

Hug SCM is a humane interface layer for version control systems, but currently only works with Git.
It transforms the complex, often intimidating Git commands into an intuitive, predictable language that feels natural to developers.

With Hug, you get:

- Intuitive commands that make sense
- Progressive safety (shorter = safer, longer = more powerful)
- Consistent patterns across all operations
- Rich feedback and previews before destructive actions
- Multi-VCS support (Git now, Mercurial and others coming later)

## Why Hug?
While Git is incredibly powerful, its command syntax can be inconsistent and difficult to remember. Hug smooths out these rough edges.

‚úÖ Making common operations trivial

`hug b feature` gets you to a branch, instead of `git checkout -b feature`

‚úÖ Keeping you safe

Destructive commands require explicit confirmation

‚úÖ Being discoverable

Commands are grouped logically: `h*` for `HEAD` operations, `w*` for working directory, `s*` for status

‚úÖ Providing superpowers

Complex operations become one-liners: `hug w zap-all` for a complete "factory reset" of your local working directory.

## Quick Start

### Basic Workflow

```shell
# Check status with beautiful output
hug s

# Stage changes (smart defaults)
hug a            # Stage tracked changes
hug aa           # Stage everything including untracked (new) files

# Commit with context
hug c            # Commit staged changes
hug ca           # Commit all tracked changes
hug caa          # Commit all tracked & untracked changes
hug cc <commit>  # Clone a Commit on top of 'HEAD'

# Branch operations
hug bc feature   # Create and switch to new branch
hug bs           # Switch back to previous branch

# Safe pull (fast-forward only; fails on divergence)
hug bpull

# Pull with rebase for linear history
hug bpullr

# Working directory cleanup
hug w zap        # Complete cleanup (reset + purge) for specific files
hug w zap-all    # Complete cleanup across the entire repository

# Park WIP (preferred over stash)
hug wip "Draft feature"    # Park and get a clean working directory (quick pause)
hug wips "Deep spike"      # Park and stay (continue immediately)
```

### Common Scenarios

```shell
# Oops, made bad changes to a file?
hug w discard file.js

# Need to undo the last commit but keep changes staged?
# Hug, Head movement: Back
hug h back

# Want to see what changed in a specific file?
# Hug, Status: Working dir (meaning unstaged changes)
hug sw file.js

# Clean up build artifacts?
hug w purge

# Get a file from an old commit?
# Hug, Working dir: Get from <commit> the file <file>
hug w get a1b2c3 file.js

# Preview a destructive operation
hug w zap-all --dry-run

# Force a cleanup without prompts
hug w zap-all -f

# Undo last 3 commits, unstage changes
# Hug, Head movement: UNDO last 3 commits
hug h undo 3

# Find steps back to last change in a file, then rewind precisely
hug h steps src/app.js  # e.g., "2 steps back..."
hug h back 2

# Safe pull (fast-forward only; fails on divergence)
hug bpull

# Pull with rebase for linear history
hug bpullr

# Park WIP for interruption (switch back to main/hotfix)
hug wip "Draft feature" ‚Üí hug bc hotfix && hug c "Fix bug" ‚Üí hug bpush

# Deep work on WIP (stay and iterate)
hug wips "Prototype UI" ‚Üí hug a . && hug c "Add components" ‚Üí hug bs (pause) ‚Üí later hug b WIP/... ‚Üí hug w unwip WIP/... (integrate)
```

**Tip: `wips` vs. `wip`**: Use `wips` for immersive sessions (stay on WIP to add commits like `hug c`). Use `wip` for quick pauses (park and switch back to main). Both are pushable branches‚Äîbetter than local stash for persistence.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/elifarley/hug-scm.git
   cd hug-scm
   ```

2. **Install** (run from repo root):
   ```shell
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Verify**:
   ```shell
   hug s  # Should show status summary
   hug help  # List available commands
   ```

**Dependencies**: Bash, Git 2.23+ (for `git restore`). Works on Linux/macOS.

## Quick Start Tips

- **No Git Knowledge Needed**: Hug handles the complexity; focus on intent.
- **Dry-Run Everything**: Add `--dry-run` to preview (e.g., `hug w zap-all --dry-run`).
- **Explore**: Run `hug help` to see Hug commands.

hug h undo [N|commit]     # Move HEAD back, unstage changes (non-destructive)
hug h rollback [N|commit] # Rollback commits and their changes (preserves local work)
hug h rewind <commit>     # Destructive rewind to clean state (discards history and changes, but keeps current untracked files)
hug h steps <file> [--raw] # Steps back from HEAD to last change in <file> (for precise rewinds)
```

#### üßπ Working Directory (`w`)

```shell
# Discard changes
hug w discard [-u|-s] <files>     # Discard unstaged/staged changes for specific files
hug w discard-all [-u|-s]         # Discard across entire repo

# Wipe changes (staged + unstaged)

```

#### Parking Work (WIP)

```shell
# Save all changes on a WIP branch (pushable, persistent)
hug wip "msg"              # Move uncommitted changes away into a new WIP branch (for interruptions)
hug wips "msg"             # Park work and stay on the new WIP branch (for focused work)

# Resume WIP
hug b <wip-branch-name>    # Switch to the WIP branch to continue

# Finish and integrate WIP

# Abandon WIP
hug w wipdel <wip-branch>  # Deletes the WIP branch without merging
```

#### üìä Status & Staging (`s`)

```shell
hug s                       # Quick summary of staged/unstaged changes

# Staging
hug a [files]               # Stage tracked files (or all if no args)
hug aa                      # Stage everything (tracked + untracked + deletions)
hug us <files>              # Unstage specific files
hug usa                     # Unstage all files
```

#### üåø Branching (`b`)

```shell
hug b <branch>              # Switch to existing branch
hug bs                      # Switch back to previous branch

## Philosophy

### 1. **Brevity Hierarchy**

-   Shorter commands = more common/safer
-   Longer commands = more specific/powerful
-   `hug b` for branch switching (most common)
-   `hug bdelr` for remote branch deletion (rare)

### 2. **Semantic Clarity**

-   Commands describe what they do
-   `w wipe` = wipe changes clean
-   `w purge` = purge unwanted files
-   `w zap` = make it pristine

### 3\. **Progressive Destructiveness**

```shell
`discard < wipe < zap < rewind`
```

### 4. **Safety First**

-   All destructive operations show previews
-   Explicit confirmations required
-   Dry-run mode everywhere

### 5. **Discoverability**

-   Related commands share prefixes
-   Built-in help with examples
-   Smart completion with partial matching

## Testing

Hug SCM uses [BATS (Bash Automated Testing System)](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) for automated testing. We have comprehensive test coverage for core commands and workflows.

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Install prerequisites and run all tests
./run-tests.sh

# Run specific test suite
./run-tests.sh tests/unit/test_status_staging.bats

# Run with verbose output
./run-tests.sh -v
```

**For Contributors:**
- All new commands must include tests
- Tests run automatically in CI on every PR
- See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed testing guide
- See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for test suite documentation
- See [ADR-001](docs/architecture/ADR-001-automated-testing-strategy.md) for testing strategy rationale

## Roadmap

-    **Mercurial Support** - Full compatibility with `hg` commands
-    **Sapling Support** - Meta's next-gen VCS
-    **Interactive Mode** - TUI with visual diff preview
-    **AI Integration** - Smart commit suggestions
-    **GUI Frontend** - Visual interface for complex operations
-    **Plugin System** - Custom command extensions
