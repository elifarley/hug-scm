[View Documentation](https://elifarley.github.io/hug-scm/)

A humane, intuitive interface for Git and other version control systems.

Works as a universal language to control the underlying SCM tool you use.

Hug transforms complex and forgettable Git commands into a simple, predictable language that feels natural to use, keeping you focused on your code, not on wrestling with version control.

## What is Hug?

Hug SCM is a humane interface layer for version control systems, but currently only works with Git.
It transforms the complex, often intimidating Git commands into an intuitive, predictable language that feels natural to developers.

With Hug, you get:

- Intuitive commands that make sense
- Progressive safety (shorter = safer, longer = more powerful)
- Consistent patterns across all operations
- Rich feedback and previews before destructive actions
- Multi-VCS support (Git now, Mercurial and others coming later)

## Why Hug?
While Git is incredibly powerful, its command syntax can be inconsistent and difficult to remember. Hug smooths out these rough edges.

‚úÖ Making common operations trivial

`hug b feature` gets you to a branch, instead of `git checkout -b feature`

‚úÖ Keeping you safe

Destructive commands require explicit confirmation

‚úÖ Being discoverable

Commands are grouped logically: `h*` for `HEAD` operations, `w*` for working directory, `s*` for status

‚úÖ Providing superpowers

Complex operations become one-liners: `hug w zap-all` for a complete "factory reset" of your local working directory.

## Quick Start

### Basic Workflow

```shell
# Check status with beautiful output
hug s

# Stage changes (smart defaults)
hug a            # Stage tracked changes
hug aa           # Stage everything including untracked (new) files

# Commit with context
hug c            # Commit staged changes
hug ca           # Commit all tracked changes
hug caa          # Commit all tracked & untracked changes
hug cc <commit>  # Clone a Commit on top of 'HEAD'

# Branch operations
hug bc feature   # Create and switch to new branch
hug bs           # Switch back to previous branch

# Working directory cleanup
hug w backup     # Stash current work safely
hug w zap        # Complete cleanup (reset + purge) for specific files
hug w zap-all    # Complete cleanup across the entire repository
```

### Common Scenarios

```shell
# Oops, made bad changes to a file?
hug w discard file.js

# Need to undo the last commit but keep changes staged?
# Hug, Head movement: Back
hug h back

# Want to see what changed in a specific file?
# Hug, Status: Working dir (meaning unstaged changes)
hug sw file.js

# Clean up build artifacts?
hug w purge

# Get a file from an old commit?
# Hug, Working dir: Get from <commit> the file <file>
hug w get a1b2c3 file.js

# Preview a destructive operation
hug w zap-all --dry-run

# Force a cleanup without prompts
hug w zap-all -f

# Undo last 3 commits, unstage changes
# Hug, Head movement: UNDO last 3 commits
hug h undo 3

# Find steps back to last change in a file, then rewind precisely
hug h steps src/app.js  # e.g., "2 steps back..."
hug h back 2
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/elifarley/hug-scm.git
   cd hug-scm
   ```

2. **Install** (run from repo root):
   ```shell
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Verify**:
   ```shell
   hug s  # Should show status summary
   hug help  # List available commands
   ```

**Dependencies**: Bash, Git 2.23+ (for `git restore`). Works on Linux/macOS.

## Quick Start Tips

- **No Git Knowledge Needed**: Hug handles the complexity; focus on intent.
- **Dry-Run Everything**: Add `--dry-run` to preview (e.g., `hug w zap-all --dry-run`).
- **Backup First**: Always `hug w backup` before destructive ops.
- **Explore**: Run `hug alias` to see all Git aliases enabled by Hug.

### Core Commands

#### üìç HEAD Operations (`h`)

```shell
hug h back [N|commit]     # Move HEAD back, keep changes staged (non-destructive)
hug h undo [N|commit]     # Move HEAD back, unstage changes (non-destructive)
hug h rollback [N|commit] # Rollback commits and their changes (preserves local work)
hug h rewind <commit>     # Destructive rewind to clean state (discards history and changes, but keeps current untracked files)
hug h steps <file> [--raw] # Steps back from HEAD to last change in <file> (for precise rewinds)
```

#### üßπ Working Directory (`w`)

```shell
# Discard changes
hug w discard [-u|-s] <files>     # Discard unstaged/staged changes for specific files
hug w discard-all [-u|-s]         # Discard across entire repo

# Wipe changes (staged + unstaged)
hug w wipe <files>                # Complete reset for specific files
hug w wipe-all                    # Reset all tracked files to last commit

# Remove untracked/ignored files
hug w purge [-u|-i] <files>       # Remove untracked/ignored for specific paths
hug w purge-all [-u|-i]           # Remove across entire repo

# Nuclear option: discard + purge
hug w zap [-u|-s|-i] <files>      # Full cleanup for specific paths
hug w zap-all [-u|-s|-i]          # Complete repo cleanup

# Utility
hug w backup [-m "msg"]           # Safe stash of changes
hug w get <commit> [files]        # Restore files from specific commit
```

hug ss [file]               # Status with staged changes patch
hug su [file]               # Status with unstaged changes patch
hug sw [file]               # Status with working dir changes patch (staged and unstaged)

# Staging
hug a [files]               # Stage tracked files (or all if no args)

```

#### üåø Branching (`b`)

```shell
hug b <branch>              # Switch to existing branch
hug bs                      # Switch back to previous branch
hug bc <branch>             # Create and switch to new branch
hug bl                      # List local branches
hug bla                     # List all branches (local + remote)
hug bdel <branch>           # Safe delete local branch (if merged)
hug bdelf <branch>          # Force delete local branch

## Philosophy

### 1. **Brevity Hierarchy**

-   Shorter commands = more common/safer
-   Longer commands = more specific/powerful
-   `hug b` for branch switching (most common)
-   `hug bdelr` for remote branch deletion (rare)

### 2. **Semantic Clarity**

-   Commands describe what they do
-   `w wipe` = wipe changes clean
-   `w purge` = purge unwanted files
-   `w zap` = make it pristine

### 3\. **Progressive Destructiveness**

```shell
`discard < wipe < zap < rewind`
```

### 4. **Safety First**

-   All destructive operations show previews
-   Explicit confirmations required
-   Dry-run mode everywhere

### 5. **Discoverability**

-   Related commands share prefixes
-   Built-in help with examples
-   Smart completion with partial matching

## Roadmap

-    **Mercurial Support** - Full compatibility with `hg` commands
-    **Sapling Support** - Meta's next-gen VCS
-    **Interactive Mode** - TUI with visual diff preview
-   \[\] **AI Integration** - Smart commit suggestions
-    **GUI Frontend** - Visual interface for complex operations
-   \[\] **Plugin System** - Custom command extensions
