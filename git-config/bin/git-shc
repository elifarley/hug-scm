hug shc: Show files changed in a commit or range with statistics.

USAGE:
    hug shc [N|<commit-ref>|<range>] [OPTIONS]

ARGUMENTS:
    N               Number of commits from HEAD (1-999) → shows cumulative changes
    <commit-ref>    Single commit reference (default: HEAD)
    <range>         Commit range like HEAD~3..HEAD or main..feature

OPTIONS:
    -q, --quiet     Suppress header line (also honors HUG_QUIET env var)
    -h, --help      Show this help

DESCRIPTION:
    Lists files changed with addition/deletion counts.
    Accepts a commit count, single commit, or commit range.

    For N (1-999), shows cumulative file changes in last N commits.
    For single commits, shows files changed in that commit.
    For ranges, shows cumulative file changes across all commits in the range.

    Use 'hug sh' for full commit details including message.

RANGE SYNTAX:
    N                 Last N commits (shorthand for HEAD~N..HEAD)
    <start>..<end>    Changes from start (exclusive) to end (inclusive)
    main..feature     Commits in feature not in main

USE CASES FOR RANGES:
    Pre-squash review    See cumulative impact before squashing commits
    Branch comparison    Compare total changes between branches
    Release review       Audit all changes in a release range
    Code review prep     Understand scope of multiple commits

EXAMPLES:
    hug shc                  # Files changed in last commit
    hug shc 3                # Cumulative changes in last 3 commits
    hug shc abc123           # Files changed in specific commit
    hug shc HEAD~2           # Files changed two commits ago
    hug shc HEAD~3..HEAD     # Cumulative changes in last 3 commits (explicit)
    hug shc main..feature    # All changes in feature branch vs main
    hug shc v1.0.0..v1.1.0   # Changes between two tags
