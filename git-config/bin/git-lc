hug lc: Search commits by CODE CHANGES in diff.

USAGE:
    hug lc <search-term> [-i] [-p] [--all] [-- [<file>]] [-h, --help]

ARGUMENTS:
    <search-term>  Text to search for in code changes (required)
    <file>         Restrict search to specific file (optional)

OPTIONS:
    -i             Ignore case when searching
    -p             Show patches
    --all          Consider ALL branches (not just current)
    -- <file>      Restrict search to specific file
    -- (last arg)  Restrict search with interactive file selection
    -h, --help     Show this help

DESCRIPTION:
    Searches for commits where the specified text was added or removed in the
    diff. This is useful for finding when a particular function, variable, or
    code pattern was introduced or changed.

EXAMPLES:
    hug lc "getUserById"            # Find commits changing this function
    hug lc "getUserById" -i         # Case-insensitive search
    hug lc "config.api" -p          # Show patches
    hug lc "import" -- src/main.js  # Search in specific file
    hug lc "import" --              # Search with interactive file selection
