hug ss: Show status with patch of staged diff.

USAGE:
    hug ss [<file>] [-h, --help]
    hug ss --
    hug ss --browse-root

ARGUMENTS:
    <file>         Show staged diff for specific file (optional)
    --             Interactive file selection from staged files (current directory scope)

OPTIONS:
    --browse-root  Browse full repository scope in file selector UI (default: current directory)
    -h, --help     Show this help

DESCRIPTION:
    Shows the diff of staged diff (what will be committed). When no file
    is specified, shows all staged diff. Use '--' to interactively select
    a file from staged files. By default, interactive selection is scoped to
    the current directory and subdirectories. Use --browse-root to browse the
    entire repository.

EXAMPLES:
    hug ss                  # Show all staged diff
    hug ss file.txt         # Show staged diff for specific file
    hug ss --               # Interactive file selection (current directory)
    hug ss --browse-root    # Interactive file selection (full repository)

SEE ALSO:
    hug su       : Show unstaged diff
    hug sw       : Show working directory changes
    hug s        : Show status
