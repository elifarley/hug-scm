hug bpush-unsafe: Unsafe force push (use with extreme caution)

USAGE:
  hug bpush-unsafe [git push options]

DESCRIPTION:
  Alias for 'hug bpush --unsafe'. Performs an unsafe force push without
  --force-with-lease protection. This can overwrite others' work.

WARNING:
  This command is DANGEROUS and should rarely be used. It can:
  - Overwrite other people's commits
  - Cause data loss
  - Break team members' local repositories
  
  Use 'hug bpushf' instead for safer force pushing.

EXAMPLES:
  hug bpush-unsafe        # Unsafe force push (dangerous!)

SEE ALSO:
  hug bpush               # Normal push (recommended)
  hug bpushf              # Force push with lease (safer alternative)

SAFETY:
  EXTREMELY UNSAFE. Only use when you fully understand the consequences
  and have coordinated with your entire team.
