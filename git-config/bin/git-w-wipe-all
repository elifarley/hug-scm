hug w wipe-all: Wipe all staged and unstaged changes across repository

USAGE:
  hug w wipe-all [options]

DESCRIPTION:
  Discards both staged and unstaged changes for all tracked files
  across the entire repository. This is a convenience command that
  combines:
    hug w discard-all -u  (all unstaged changes)
    hug w discard-all -s  (all staged changes)
  
  Does not affect untracked or ignored files.

EXAMPLES:
  hug w wipe-all              # Wipe all changes repo-wide
  hug w wipe-all --dry-run    # Preview what would be wiped
  hug w wipe-all -f           # Skip confirmation

OPTIONS:
  --dry-run    Preview what would be wiped without making changes
  -f, --force  Skip confirmation prompts

SEE ALSO:
  hug w wipe         # Wipe changes for specific files
  hug w discard-all  # Discard unstaged OR staged changes repo-wide
  hug w zap-all      # Complete repo cleanup (wipe + purge)

SAFETY:
  Removes all uncommitted work from tracked files. Use --dry-run first.
  This is a destructive operation - make sure you want to lose all changes.

# Convenience alias: wipe-all == discard-all staged + unstaged repo-wide
exec hug w discard-all -u -s "$@"
