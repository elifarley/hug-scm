hug h rewind: Make HEAD walk back some commits while DISCARDING their changes. Uncommitted changes are DISCARDED.

USAGE:
    hug h rewind [N|COMMIT] [-u, --upstream] [-t, --temporal TIME] [--quiet] [--force]

OPTIONS:
    -u, --upstream  Sets target to upstream remote tip after read-only preview/confirmation (discards everything after remote tip; no fetch)
    -t, --temporal TIME
                    Specify commits by time instead of count/commit
                    TIME can be relative (e.g., "3 days ago", "1 week ago")
                    or absolute (e.g., "2024-01-15", "2024-01-15 10:30")
                    Reference point is HEAD's commit time
    --quiet         Suppress output (sets HUG_QUIET=T)
    --force         Skip confirmation prompts (use with caution; highly destructive)

DESCRIPTION:
    Moves HEAD back to target (full clean). With -u, runs a read-only preview/confirmation before discarding local-only commits and uncommitted changes to sync with remote tip.
    With -t/--temporal, moves HEAD to the first commit at or after the specified time.

EXAMPLES:
    # Uncommitted changes are DISCARDED in all examples below:
    hug h rewind -u              # Moves HEAD back to upstream
    hug h rewind 3               # Moves HEAD back last 3 commits
    hug h rewind a1b2c3          # Moves HEAD back after specified commit
    hug h rewind 3 --force       # Skip confirmation (dangerous!)
    hug h rewind -t "3 days ago" # Rewind to first commit from 3 days ago
    hug h rewind -t "1 week ago" # Rewind to first commit from 1 week ago
