h undo: Make HEAD walk back some commits while keeping their changes unstaged. Uncommitted changes are preserved.

USAGE:
    hug h undo [N|COMMIT] [-u, --upstream] [-t, --temporal TIME] [--quiet] [--force]

OPTIONS:
    -u, --upstream  Sets the target to upstream remote tip after read-only preview/confirmation (discards local-only commits; no fetch)
    -t, --temporal TIME
                    Specify commits by time instead of count/commit
                    TIME can be relative (e.g., "3 days ago", "1 week ago")
                    or absolute (e.g., "2024-01-15", "2024-01-15 10:30")
                    Reference point is HEAD's commit time
    --quiet         Suppress output (sets HUG_QUIET=T)
    --force         Skip confirmation prompts (use with caution)

DESCRIPTION:
    Moves HEAD to target. With -u, runs a read-only preview/confirmation before discarding local-only commits to sync with remote tip.
    With -t/--temporal, moves HEAD to the first commit at or after the specified time.

EXAMPLES:
    # Uncommitted changes are preserved in all examples below:
    hug h undo -u                # Moves HEAD to upstream, keep local changes unstaged
    hug h undo 3                 # Moves HEAD last 3 commits
    hug h undo a1b2c3            # Moves HEAD after specified commit
    hug h undo 3 --force         # Skip confirmation
    hug h undo -t "3 days ago"   # Move HEAD to first commit from 3 days ago
    hug h undo -t "1 week ago"   # Move HEAD to first commit from 1 week ago
