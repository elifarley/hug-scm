hug bpushf: Force push current branch with lease (safer force push)

USAGE:
  hug bpushf [git push options]

DESCRIPTION:
  Alias for 'hug bpush --force'. Force pushes with --force-with-lease,
  which is safer than regular force push as it checks that the remote
  hasn't changed since your last fetch.

EXAMPLES:
  hug bpushf              # Force push current branch with lease

SEE ALSO:
  hug bpush              # Normal push
  hug bpush-unsafe       # Unsafe force push (use with extreme caution)

SAFETY:
  Uses --force-with-lease for safer force pushing. Still coordinate
  with your team before force pushing shared branches.

# Alias for hug bpush --force
exec hug bpush --force "$@"
