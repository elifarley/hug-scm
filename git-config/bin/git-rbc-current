hug rbc-current: Resolve the present rebase conflict by picking the "current" branch (your changes) version.

USAGE:
    hug rbc-current [--all] [--quiet] [-h, --help]

OPTIONS:
    --all          Resolve conflicts in current commit and automatically apply the same strategy (pick current) to all remaining conflicting commits, completing the rebase
    --quiet        Suppress output (sets HUG_QUIET=T)
    -h, --help     Show this help

DESCRIPTION:
    During a rebase, one or more commits from the current branch being rebased may conflict with changes from the other branch.
    'rbc-current' picks the version from the current branch (the branch being rebased).
    This affects all conflicting files in the current commit being rebased.
    USe --all to finish the entire rebase using this same choice.
    WARNING: This rewrites history. Ensure you understand the conflict before using --all.

EXAMPLES:
    hug rbc-current          # Resolve current conflicting commit with your changes and continue
    hug rbc-current --all    # Resolve all remaining conflicting commits with your changes

SEE ALSO:
    hug rbc-other    Pick the other branch (the target, the one with incoming changes) version
    hug rbc          For manually resolving a conflict and continuing the rebase operation
