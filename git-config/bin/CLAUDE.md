- In shell scripts, NEVER use the `local` keyword outside a function body!
- Scripts should always follow the D.R.Y. principle, have high maintainability and elegance.
- Try to keep most of the work in library functions (../lib/) while the scripts themselves basically work as a thin layer that call the library to promote maximum code reuse
