# 🏁 Hug Commands Cheat Sheet 🏁

A quick reference for daily workflows with Hug SCM. Focus on intuitive commands that keep you coding, not wrestling Git. Grouped by common scenarios.

## Setup & Installation
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/elifarley/hug-scm.git
cd hug-scm
./install.sh

# Verify
hug s    # **S**tatus check
hug help # List all commands
```

## Basic Workflow
```bash
# Check status (colored summary)
hug sl    # **S**tatus + **L**ist

# Stage changes for commit
hug aa   # **A**dd **A**ll (tracked + untracked)
hug a    # **A**dd tracked

# Commit staged changes
hug c "Add login feature"  # **C**ommit

# View history
hug l    # **L**og
hug ll   # **L**og **L**ong
```

## Branching & Switching
```bash
# List branches
hug bl   # **B**ranch **L**ist (local)
hug blr  # **B**ranch **L**ist **R**emote

# Create and switch
hug bc feature-branch  # **B**ranch **C**reate

# Switch to existing (interactive menu)
hug b    # **B**ranch

# Merge (squash, no commit)
hug m feature-branch  # **M**erge

# Delete (safe)
hug bdel old-branch    # **B**ranch **DEL**ete (local)
hug bdelr old-remote-branch  # **B**ranch **DEL**ete **R**emote
```

## Syncing with Remote
```bash
# Push current branch (sets upstream)
hug bpush  # **B**ranch **Push**

# Safe fast-forward pull (fails if merge/rebase needed)
hug bpull  # **B**ranch **Pull**

# Pull with rebase (linear history)
hug bpullr  # **B**ranch **Pull** **R**ebase

# Safe force push (for rewritten local history)
hug bpushf  # **B**ranch **Push** **F**orce
```
> **CRITICAL**: Always review before pushing. Run `hug lol` (**L**og **O**utgoing **L**ong) for a full preview of commits that will be pushed, followed by a final status check.

## Inspection & Discovery
```bash
# See what will be pushed
hug lol  # **L**og **O**utgoing **L**ong

# Most recent commit touching a file
hug llf <file> -1  # **L**og **L**ookup **F**ile

# Who changed each line in a file
hug fblame <file>  # **F**ile **B**lame

# Who contributed to a file
hug fcon <file>  # **F**ile **CON**tributors

# Search commit messages
hug lf "fix bug"  # **L**og message **F**ilter

# Search code changes
hug lc "getUser"  # **L**og **C**ode search
```

## Undoing & Cleaning Up
```bash
# Discard unstaged changes in a file
hug w discard <file>  # **W**orking directory **Discard**

# Discard ALL unstaged changes
hug w discard-all  # **W**orking directory **discard** **ALL**

# Full reset of tracked files (staged + unstaged)
hug w wipe-all  # **W**orking directory **W**ipe **ALL**

# Remove all untracked/ignored files
hug w purge-all  # **W**orking directory **P**urge **ALL**

# Undo last commit (keep changes staged)
hug h back  # **H**EAD **Back**

# Undo last commit (keep changes unstaged)
hug h undo  # **H**EAD **Undo**

# Rewind to a clean state (destructive)
hug h rewind  # **H**EAD **Rewind**

# Find how many steps back to last file change
hug h steps <file>  # **H**EAD **Steps**

# Revert a specific commit (creates a new commit undoing it)
hug revert <commit-hash>
```

## WIP (Work-In-Progress) Workflow
```bash
# Park all changes on a new WIP branch to have a clean working directory (free from uncommitted changes)
hug wip "Pausing work on feature X"  # **W**ork **I**n **P**rogress

# Park all changes on a new WIP branch and Stay on it
hug wips "Starting a focused spike"  # **W**ork **I**n **P**rogress **S**tay

# Integrate a WIP branch into your current branch (squash-merge)
hug w unwip WIP/YY-MM-DD/HHMM.slug  # **Un**park **W**ork **I**n **P**rogress

# Delete a WIP branch without integrating it
hug w wipdel WIP/YY-MM-DD/HHMM.slug  # **W**ork **I**n **P**rogress **DEL**ete
```

## Tips
- **Get a reminder**: Forgetting a command? Just type `hug help` to see all families.
- **Check before you act**: `hug sl` is your best friend. Run it often.
- Hug's `bpull` and `bpullr` handle fetching for you in most cases. But you can run `hug fetch` to get the latest remote info without affecting your local branches.
