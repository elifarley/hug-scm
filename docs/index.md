# Welcome to Hug Documentation

Hug is a collection of Git tools and workflows to streamline development. It provides a humane, intuitive interface for Git, transforming complex commands into a predictable language that keeps you focused on coding.

Key features:
- **Intuitive Commands**: Shorter for common/safe ops, longer for powerful ones (e.g., `hug b` to switch branches).
- **Safety Built-In**: Previews, dry-runs, and confirmations for destructive actions.
- **Discoverability**: Grouped by prefix (e.g., `h*` for HEAD, `w*` for working directory).
- **Git-Only for Now**: Full Git support; Mercurial and others coming soon.
